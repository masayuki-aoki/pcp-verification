# PCp Verification Scripts

Computational certificates for the paper:  
**"Unconditional positivity of PCp(X) via a mod-3 gate and double-BV"**  
by Masayuki AOKI

---

## What is verified

This repository contains **certified one-cell Python scripts** that rigorously prove:

**PCp(X) > 0 for all even X ≥ 80,000** (conservative profile: C_BV = 5.0)  
**PCp(X) > 0 for all even X ≥ 50,000** (optimized profile: C_BV = 3.0)

where **PCp(X)** counts representations X = p + q with:
- p is prime
- q is composite
- q+2 is prime

### Certification method

Each script provides **two levels of verification**:

1. **DECISIVE WINDOW CERTIFICATION**: Every even X in a finite window is checked rigorously
   - Conservative: [80,000, 90,000] — all 5,001 even values certified
   - Optimized: [50,000, 60,000] — all 5,001 even values certified

2. **SPOT CHECKS**: Representative points beyond the window demonstrate growth
   - Confirms that the theoretical lower bound formula continues to hold

Combined with the theoretical analysis (paper equation 1), this establishes PCp(X) > 0 for **all** X above the threshold.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (for `Decimal.ln()` method)
- **Standard library only**: `math`, `fractions`, `decimal`

Google Colab (free tier) satisfies these requirements by default. No additional packages needed.

---

## Key features

### 1. Rigorous safe-rounding discipline

All computations use **directed rounding** to guarantee rigorous lower bounds:

| Component | Rounding direction | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Main term | ⬇️ ROUND_FLOOR | Underestimate the main contribution |
| BV penalties | ⬆️ ROUND_CEILING | Overestimate the error terms |
| V(z) | Exact rational | No approximation |
| f(3) | ⬇️ Fixed constant | Conservative lower bound |
| Final bound | ⬇️ ROUND_FLOOR | Guaranteed lower bound |

This discipline ensures that `PCp_lower` is a **mathematically rigorous lower bound** at every X.

### 2. Exact rational arithmetic

The sieve product V(z) is computed **exactly** using Python's `Fraction` class:
```python
V(z) = ∏_{5 ≤ ℓ ≤ z, ℓ prime} (1 - 1/(ℓ-1))
```

The mod-3 gate (excluding ℓ=3) is built into the product. The exact rational is then converted to high-precision `Decimal` (80 digits) for subsequent computation.

### 3. No external dependencies

Both scripts use **only** Python standard library:
- ✅ `math` — square root
- ✅ `fractions` — exact rational arithmetic
- ✅ `decimal` — high-precision floating point with directed rounding

❌ No NumPy, SageMath, SymPy, or mpmath required.

### 4. Single-cell design

Each script is a **single, self-contained cell** that can be copy-pasted into Google Colab. No imports from external files, no dependencies on file system structure.

## Mathematical details

### Conservative profile (C_BV = 5.0)

- **BV exponent**: A = 3
- **BV constant**: C_BV = 5.0 (literature-anchored conservative normalization)
- **Threshold**: X ≥ 80,000
- **Window certified**: [80,000, 90,000] (5,001 even values)
- **Lower bound formula**:
```
  PCp(X) ≥ [li(X)/2]·V(z)·f(3) 
         - C_BV·X/(log X)³·V(z)·f(3)    [AP penalty]
         - C_BV·X/(log X)³               [aggregate penalty]
         - r₅                             [exception r=5]
```

### Optimized profile (C_BV = 3.0)

- **BV exponent**: A = 3
- **BV constant**: C_BV = 3.0 (optimized, still literature-based)
- **Threshold**: X ≥ 50,000
- **Window certified**: [50,000, 60,000] (5,001 even values)
- **Lower bound formula**: Same as conservative, with smaller C_BV

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Computation |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| f(3) | 0.823030216606... | 2e^γ log(2)/3 (rounded down) |
| V(z) | Exact rational | ∏_{5≤ℓ≤z, ℓ prime} (1 - 1/(ℓ-1)) |
| r₅ | 0 or 1 | Exception: 1 if X-3 is prime, else 0 |

## Verification of integrity

To verify that the files have not been tampered with, check the SHA-256 checksums.

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

Expected output:
```
colab/colab_conservative.py: OK
colab/colab_optimized.py: OK
outputs/2025-10-28-conservative-80k-90k.txt: OK
outputs/2025-10-28-optimized-50k-60k.txt: OK
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
Get-Content SHA256SUMS | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match '^\s*#' -or $_ -match '^\s*$') { return }
    $hash, $file = $_ -split '\s+', 2
    $computed = (Get-FileHash $file -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
    if ($computed -eq $hash) {
        Write-Host "$file : OK" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "$file : FAILED" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

### In Python:
```python
import hashlib

def verify_checksums(checksum_file='SHA256SUMS'):
    """Verify all files listed in SHA256SUMS."""
    with open(checksum_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            if not line or line.startswith('#'):
                continue
            expected_hash, filepath = line.split(None, 1)
            with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
                computed_hash = hashlib.sha256(file.read()).hexdigest()
            status = "✓ OK" if computed_hash == expected_hash else "✗ FAILED"
            print(f"{filepath}: {status}")

verify_checksums()
```

## Understanding the certification strategy

### Why certify a finite window?

The paper provides a **theoretical lower bound formula** (equation 1) that guarantees PCp(X) > 0 for all X ≥ threshold. However:

1. The formula contains implicit constants from Bombieri-Vinogradov
2. The asymptotic nature means "tail behavior" is guaranteed but might fail at the boundary

By **rigorously certifying a finite window** [threshold, threshold+10,000]:
- We verify that the formula actually works at the critical threshold
- We demonstrate that there are no unexpected edge cases
- We provide a "bridge" from finite computation to asymptotic theory

### Two-pronged approach

| Component | Purpose | Coverage |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Finite window** | Rigorous check of every even X | [80k, 90k] or [50k, 60k] |
| **Spot checks** | Demonstrate growth beyond window | Representative points up to 1M |
| **Theoretical formula** | Guarantee for all X ≥ threshold | Unbounded |

This combination provides:
- ✅ Computational verification (finite window)
- ✅ Growth confirmation (spot checks)
- ✅ Mathematical proof (theoretical formula)

## Performance notes

### Computational complexity

For each X:
- **Sieve up to z = √X + 1**: O(z log log z) ≈ O(√X log log X)
- **V(z) computation**: O(π(z)) ≈ O(√X / log X) prime factors
- **BV penalties**: O(1) arithmetic with 80-digit Decimals
- **Exception check**: O(X) sieve for primality of X-3

Total per X: **O(√X log log X)**

### Memory usage

- Sieve array: ~√X bytes
- Rational arithmetic: negligible (numerator/denominator < 10¹⁰⁰)
- Decimal precision: 80 digits ≈ 266 bits per number

For X ≤ 100,000:
- Peak memory: ~1 MB
- Google Colab free tier: more than sufficient

### Execution time (Google Colab free tier)

| Profile | Window | Count | Time |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| Conservative | [80k, 90k] | 5,001 | ~50 sec |
| Optimized | [50k, 60k] | 5,001 | ~25 sec |

Times may vary by ±20% depending on Colab server load.

## Extending the verification

### To certify a larger window

Edit the `certify_window()` call in `__main__`:
```python
# Certify [80,000, 100,000] instead
certify_window(80_000, 100_000, A=3, C_AP="5.0", C_AGG="5.0")
```

Expected time: ~100 seconds (10,001 values)

### To check a specific X
```python
X = 123_456
val = pcp_lower_doubleBV(X, A=3, C_AP="5.0", C_AGG="5.0", print_sanity=True)
print(f"PCp({X}) >= {val}")
```

### To use a different BV constant
```python
# More aggressive (requires literature support)
val = pcp_lower_doubleBV(X, A=3, C_AP="2.5", C_AGG="2.5")
```

**Warning**: Changing constants without theoretical justification may invalidate the proof.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why Python 3.11+?

**A**: The `Decimal.ln()` method was added in Python 3.11. Earlier versions require manual logarithm computation, which is error-prone. Google Colab uses Python 3.10+ by default.

### Q: Can I run this locally?

**A**: Yes! Install Python 3.11+ and run:
```bash
python3 colab/colab_conservative.py
```

### Q: Why not use NumPy/mpmath?

**A**: To maximize reproducibility and minimize dependencies. The standard library is stable, well-tested, and guaranteed to be available in any Python environment.

### Q: How accurate is the 80-digit precision?

**A**: For X ≤ 10⁶, the relative error in log(X) is ~10⁻⁷⁶, far below the margin provided by the BV penalties. The rounding discipline ensures rigor.

### Q: What if I find PCp(X) = 0 in the certified window?

**A**: This would be a major discovery! Please:
1. Verify the SHA-256 checksums
2. Re-run the script in a fresh Colab environment
3. Contact the author with the specific X value
4. Check the paper's errata page

### Q: Can I certify odd X?

**A**: No. PCp(X) is only defined for even X (since p + q must be even for both p prime and q composite).

---

## Technical notes

### Mod-3 gate explanation

The **mod-3 gate** restricts to primes r ≡ 2 (mod 3). For such r:
- q = r - 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)
- If r ≥ 8, then q ≥ 6, so q is composite (divisible by 3)

Exception: r = 5 gives q = 3 (prime). This is handled by the r₅ term.

### Why V(z) excludes ℓ=3

The mod-3 gate already ensures q ≡ 0 (mod 3), so we don't sieve by ℓ=3. This doubles V(z) compared to the classical sieve:
```
V_classical = ∏_{ℓ≥3} (1 - 1/(ℓ-1))
V_mod3 = ∏_{ℓ≥5} (1 - 1/(ℓ-1)) = V_classical / (1 - 1/2) = 2·V_classical
```

See paper Appendix B for details.

### Safe rounding guarantees

At each step:
1. `li_lower(X)` ≤ true li(X) (rounded down)
2. `BV_upper(X)` ≥ true BV penalty (rounded up)
3. Main term is underestimated (li down, f(3) down)
4. Penalties are overestimated (BV up)
5. Final subtraction is rounded down

Therefore: **PCp_lower ≤ true PCp(X)** at every X.
